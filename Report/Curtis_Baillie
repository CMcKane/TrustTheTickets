        Fixed bugs that were stopping users from registering
    - Versus Page (Search by Team)
        Wrote endpoints and queries to call DB to get events by team (back_door.py, sql_handler.py)
        Created functionality allowing a user to select a team, and returned all games in the future against that team
        Added buttons for each game linking to event seating chart
            Later changed button from being on team name to being on logo
        Added logos of each team to versus page
        Removed 76ers programmatically from the query so that they did not appear in list of teams
        Implemented card functionality
            Click on a logo of a team, cards now appear with each game's info (date, time)

    - Pick Tickets page (seating chart)
        Fixed the way teams were displayed so that it was (Away Team) (Home Team)

            Wrote endpoint and query to call DB to return only listings that had a min_sell_num of at least the Number of tickets selected

        Added min_sell_num to all previous queries
        Made change that stopped users from purchasing less than min_sell_num in pick-tickets modal.
            Displays a message stating that the user must purchase at least the min_sell_num until that number of tickets has been checked.
