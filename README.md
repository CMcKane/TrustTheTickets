## Python

Download latest version of Python 3 (python 3.6.2)
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download Pycharm (recommended but not necessary)
For pycharm make sure project interpreter is python 3
File -> Default Settings -> Project Interpreter
On command line run the following - pip3 install flask
(Pip is python package management tool, you can install any just about package via pip3 install ____)

### Flask

A basic python file using flask is included in the project repo in the py folder - testapp.py. Just run the code to start the flask service. Go to the ‚Äú/‚Äù URL in browser to see output. 

## Mysql

If you‚Äôre not a command line person go here https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ . Otherwise read on..

### Mac users

This guideline works perfectly
If you don‚Äôt have Homebrew, go here first
Then do the following:


### Windows people üôÑ 

I know you Windows people hate command line so see above

## React

### Mac users

Install homebrew if you haven‚Äôt 
brew install node

### Windows

Install latest version of node.js

### After node installed (mac/windows users)

Navigate to js directory in project repo. On the command line run the following:
npm install
npm start
If you make changes to any JS files and save them your website will automatically reload to reflect those changes.
